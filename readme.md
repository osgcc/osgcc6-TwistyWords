## Twisty-words

This is a clone of text twist I did as a side thing for the [open source game coding competition](http://osgcc.org).
It's pretty simple. Type the anagrams of the given letters, get the the next round by finding a six-letter word. Good.

### Running

* Download and Install love2d [here](https://love2d.org/).
* Download this code.
* Execute `love .` within the directory with the lua files.
